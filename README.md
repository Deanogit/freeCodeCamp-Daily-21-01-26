## What I Learned

1. Regex vs String Replace: `.replaceAll()` is great for simple text, it can't "wrap" content based on a pattern - only Regex can do that effectively.

2. Greediness: I practised using the `?` quantifier to ensure that multiple inline code blocks on one line don't get merged into one giant block.

3. Group referencing: I reinforced how to use `$1` in a replacement string to reference captured data from a regular expression.
